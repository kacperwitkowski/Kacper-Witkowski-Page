Flights-Blog is the site made for people who are looking for the plane tickets in fair prices. On this site you can browse in the offers I found by myself (by the time you are looking on this site they might be not avalaible and I can be too lazy to update them too often :P). Flights-blog also allows users to play in very popular game lately, called "Wordle" but on my site this game is made only from "traveling" words what makes it even more fun to play! In app I'm using Sanity CMS that allows me to add offers without using the code.
